# Assessment 11: Dynamic Memory Allocation

## Objective

Understand how to allocate and free memory dynamically using pointers and the `malloc`/`free` functions.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `assessment_11.c`.
2. Write a C program that:
   - Allocates memory dynamically for an array of integers.
   - Prompts the user to input the size of the array and its elements.
   - Prints the elements and frees the allocated memory.

3. Compile and run the program.

## Expected Output

```c
Enter the size of the array: 5 Enter 5 integers: 1 2 3 4 5 Array elements: 1 2 3 4 5 Memory freed successfully.
```

## Skills Covered

- Using `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free`.
- Dynamic memory management.
- Avoiding memory leaks.
