# Assessment 12: Linked Lists

## Objective

Learn how to implement and manipulate linked lists, a fundamental data structure in C.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `assessment_12.c`.
2. Write a C program that:
   - Implements a singly linked list.
   - Includes functions to add a node at the end, delete a node, and print the list.
   - Demonstrates the usage of these functions.

3. Compile and run the program.

## Expected Output

```c
Linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 After deletion: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5
```

## Skills Covered

- Understanding linked lists.
- Manipulating nodes and pointers in a linked list.
- Implementing basic linked list operations.
