# Assessment 13: Recursion

## Objective

Master recursion, a powerful technique in C programming that involves functions calling themselves.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `assessment_13.c`.
2. Write a C program that:
   - Implements a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
   - Implements a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
   - Demonstrates the usage of these functions.

3. Compile and run the program.

## Expected Output

```c
Factorial of 5: 120 10th Fibonacci number: 55
```

## Skills Covered

- Understanding and implementing recursion.
- Writing recursive functions.
- Recognizing base cases and recursive cases.
