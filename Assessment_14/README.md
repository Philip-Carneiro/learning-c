# Assessment 14: Bitwise Operations

## Objective

Learn how to manipulate individual bits using bitwise operators, a key skill for low-level programming.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `assessment_14.c`.
2. Write a C program that:
   - Demonstrates the usage of bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`).
   - Includes a function that counts the number of 1-bits in an integer.

3. Compile and run the program.

## Expected Output

```c
Bitwise AND: 1 Bitwise OR: 7 Bitwise XOR: 6 Bitwise NOT: -8 Left Shift: 16 Right Shift: 1 Number of 1-bits in 5: 2
```

## Skills Covered

- Using bitwise operators.
- Manipulating bits.
- Understanding binary representations.
