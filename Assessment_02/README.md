# Assessment 02: Basic Arithmetic

## Objective

In this assessment, you'll create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two integers. This will help you understand data types, variables, and operators in C.

## Instructions

1. Create a file named `assessment_02.c`.
2. Write a C program that:
   - Asks the user to input two integers.
   - Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the integers.
   - Displays the results of these operations.

3. Compile and run the program.

## Expected Output

```c
Enter the first integer: 10 Enter the second integer: 5

10 + 5 = 15 10 - 5 = 5 10 * 5 = 50 10 / 5 = 2
```

## Skills Covered

- Declaring and using variables.
- Using arithmetic operators.
- Basic input/output in C.
